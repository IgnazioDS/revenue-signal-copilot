# Revenue Signal Copilot

> A lead intelligence and prioritization system that scores accounts using public signals and internal notes.

[**Live dashboard →**](https://revenue-signal-copilot.eleventh.dev) · Stage: Ready to build · Track: AI/ML · Category: Business Tool

## What this is

**Problem.** Outbound teams chase low-signal leads because enrichment and prioritization are fragmented across tools.

**Why now.** Small teams need leverage from AI systems that can turn scattered signals into action.

## Built for

Sales teams, agencies, founder-led GTM teams.

## What ships first

The MVP scope this project commits to:

- Ingest CRM exports and website data
- Score leads with transparent factors
- Generate account briefs and outreach angles
- Track conversion feedback to refine scoring

## Product stack

Python · FastAPI · Pandas · PostgreSQL · LLMs

## This repo

The repo currently ships a **showcase-tier** Next.js 14 dashboard at the live URL above plus a stdlib-only Python serverless function at `api/stats.py` that exposes Tier-B telemetry derived from GitHub (commits, stars, last commit, primary language, lines of code). The MVP application stack listed above is the system this dashboard will graduate to — it is not yet running production workload. See [TELEMETRY_SCHEMA.md](https://github.com/IgnazioDS/IgnazioDS/blob/main/TELEMETRY_SCHEMA.md) for what honest telemetry tiers mean here.
